    "\n",
    "2. **Configuration II (PII)** - case where one node connects to two neighbors which are far from each other.  Link with the most distant node is removed from the graph. Let us emphasize that in case a node has more than three neighbors, only the most distant onis removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration III (PIII)** - another conflicting situation where two nodes are connected to the same neighbor in $F_{k+1}$. If only one of the node has more than two neighbors then its connection with the common neighbor is removed. If both nodes have more than two neighbors, the longest connection with the common neighbor is removed.\n",
